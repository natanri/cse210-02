# This activity treats about a game called Hilo, in which we need to create a game to handle the principles of abstraction, the main idea of this game is the first card will show us the first number then we should guess if the next number is lower or higher than previous one. Each player will go to star with 300 points and every time the player guesses if is higher or lower he/she will gain 100 points otherwise he/she will lose 75 points. They will lose when the point is gone.
